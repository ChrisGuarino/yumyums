## You may need to install the huggingface api. Other than that you should be good to run this code. 
## There is more helper code but I dont think they are needed for this module. But I will be migrating them over when i have  a moment. 
### Dataset: https://huggingface.co/ChrisGuarino/cat_ds - It's very small. But just wanted to make sure I had the flow of data right before collecting more data.
